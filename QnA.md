# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?
- I don't see it as a risk per say but I can see that the title being variable length will be tricky
- the time factor of approximately 4 hours
- potential data issue with the github API

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?
- links to the issues
- options to search without the full URL

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.
- more filtering options
- issue viewer
- routing
- infinite scroll

-

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

-

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

-

> Did you learn anything new?

-

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
